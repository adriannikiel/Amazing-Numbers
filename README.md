## Official description

### About
We use numbers every day. But do you know how many different properties they have? Let's take a look at some of the amazing properties of numbers. After completing this project, you will write a program that knows how to determine whether a number is Palindromic or Gapful, or how to distinguish Spy numbers from others. Numbers can be fascinating!
### Learning outcomes
The project covers basic operations on integers, as well as with Java collections. Make a program that indicates the properties of the numbers taken from the input.
